                    I have worked on a few projects outside of classes!

                    I like to make games in my free time! I have made a few console programs using visual studio in c#, and I've worked on a couple of larger scale projects using GameMaker Studio. I also like making music in FL Studio, and I'm learning Avid ProTools to do more professional work.

                    In class, I have been learning c# and also more general forms of media, like Photoshop.
