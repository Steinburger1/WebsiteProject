            <p>This is Connor. He is pretty good at hockey. He does computer science here, but he often slacks off. He can be dumb sometimes, but he makes me feel smart by comparison. I can always make fun of his moronic opinions of music, and I make him listen to music he hates. He tried drawing one time, but it was so bad that I incessantly mocked him for it. <strong>I. Hate. Connor.</strong></p>
            <p><em>Disclaimer: I don't actually hate Connor. He's a friend of mine and thought this was funny.</em></p>
