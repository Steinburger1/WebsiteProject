                    Here's a little bit about me and my past experience!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in Massachusetts, and I spent most of my childhood there. I've always been interested in computers and coding, so I chose game design as a major as a way to still have fun with my career.

                    I worked at Supercharged Entertainment, a go-kart place, over the summer as a track marshall. I also have experience coding from schoolwork and individual study with certain languages.
